## 📘 Project Overview

This repository contains the code, data preparation, and analysis for the *Asset Pricing* course assignment.  
The project investigates how **Risk-Premium Principal Component Analysis (RP-PCA)** compares to both **standard PCA** and **Fama–French-style factor construction** in explaining the cross-section of expected returns.

Empirical asset pricing has identified a “**factor zoo**” — an overwhelming number of firm and portfolio characteristics correlated with returns. Using PCA-based approaches, this project explores how to **reduce dimensionality** while preserving **pricing information**.
